# Label-Consistent-Autoencoder
This is a MATLAB function implementing an autoencoder which incorporates label information in the cost function. 
Use of label information while deriving AE weights helps derive better hidden layer representation.

The code is associated with the paper titled " Label Consistent Autoencoder" submitted to IEEE Transaction on Image Processing.
